# Build

If you want to build it yourself, you can do the following:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The package `RPi.GPIO` is available on the Raspberry Pi OS or Linux OS tuned by Raspberry Pi Foundation. So you should run following command on Raspberry Pi.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jyje/pifanctl ~/.pifanctl
cd ~/.pifanctl/sources
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.raspi.txt
python ~/.pifanctl/sources/main.py --help
```

Then you can use the following command to control the fan:
